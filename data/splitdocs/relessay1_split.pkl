S"The movie \xe2\x80\x9cIkiru\xe2\x80\x9d both affirms and inverts Weber's argument that the inescapable \xe2\x80\x9ciron cage\xe2\x80\x9d created around man (by bureaucracies and their suffocating sets of rational rules) limits human freedom. Though the main character of the film does reside within the \xe2\x80\x9ciron cage\xe2\x80\x9d of his bureaucratic rules, he is still able to fully experience life and is not robbed of his humanity. Furthermore, the film agrees with Henry David Thoreau's ideas from the book \xe2\x80\x9cWalden\xe2\x80\x9d that men should \xe2\x80\x9clive deeply and suck the marrow out of life\xe2\x80\x9d, and that the capitalist culture seeks to limit a person's individuality for the sake of efficiency. However, it shows that Thoreau's pessimistic generalizations about the dehumanization of capitalist \xe2\x80\x9csleepers\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily true. It qualifies both Weber's and Thoreau's arguments by stipulating that human will and sloth play a large role in determining the degree to which someone \xe2\x80\x9clives\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\tIn the final scene of the movie, Watanabe is sitting on a swing in his own park. At first, we glimpse him only through the interlocking bars of the swingset, and then the camera circles around to show the rest of the park, which is filled with grass and plants, and our main character sitting on his swing, singing the song, \xe2\x80\x9cLife is Brief\xe2\x80\x9d. This plays with Weber's conception of the \xe2\x80\x9ciron cage\xe2\x80\x9d; underscoring the fact that the park, and Watanabe himself, reside within the domain of Weber's rational bureaucracy. And yet, the very fact that the park exists contradicts Weber's idea that bureaucracy limits human freedom and expression. This shows that the human will is capable (albeit infrequently) of defying the repressive power of Weber's \xe2\x80\x9ciron cage\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\tAlternatively, the park can be equated with Thoreau's conception of \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d. In Thoreau's writings, the word nature is taken to mean the state of the Earth, and the state"

aS"of man, when unaffected by human capitalist culture. Thoreau believes that Earthly nature, since it is designed by God, is a reflection of the most fundamental truths of the human experience. When we live in Earthly nature, Thoreau says, we abandon the artificial structure that we impose upon our everyday lives, and return to the most fundamental aspects of the human experience. Thus, nature is equated with the divine, and the enforced structure of capitalism on our everyday lives with the mundane. In \xe2\x80\x9cWalden\xe2\x80\x9d, Thoreau contrasts his experience of being woken by birds, with nothing to do but reflect on his own humanity, with waking up to the cold alarm clock, designed to suck away his humanity and use him as a means toward a corporate end. It would seem all but impossible, in Thoreau's mind, to see nature and bureaucracy coexist \xe2\x80\x93 and yet this is exactly what happens in the ending of \xe2\x80\x9cIkiru\xe2\x80\x9d. We see the fully formed park \xe2\x80\x93 an external reflection of Watanabe's return to his most fundamental state of being alive, achieved within the boundaries of a gridlike cage. This could be taken to mean that the \xe2\x80\x9ciron cage\xe2\x80\x9d does not completely stifle humanity; that \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d, as defined by Thoreau, can be found within it, if we choose to look for it.\n\n\tAnother important difference with Thoreau is that Thoreau believes that the self-denial that capitalist workers are forced to practice cannot be used to find fulfillment. On the other hand, Kurosawa finds harmony between the service of others and self-realization. In the movie \xe2\x80\x9cIkiru\xe2\x80\x9d, the protagonist is able to achieve fulfillment with his determination to build something for others (i.e. building the park for the women), and the bureaucrats' greed is their true downfall. They do not accomplish any notable work while in the office,"

aS"but they come every day to collect their paychecks and protect their positions, in order to serve themselves. The hero of the movie is more like one of Benjamin Franklin's \xe2\x80\x9cideal capitalists\xe2\x80\x9d than anything else. He is selfless, and he finds fulfillment in the completion of his duty, is to serve others. However, the film acknowledges that not all members of society achieve this ideal state \xe2\x80\x93 unlike what Thoreau describes in \xe2\x80\x9cWalden\xe2\x80\x9d, most of the bureaucrats in the movie display only self-interest, which results in their stunted self-development.\n\n\tThe nature of the human will and human error is something examined at great lengths within this film. Though the film does suggest that structural aspects of capitalism push us to abandon our humanity, it also attributes a large portion of this to our own human weakness and miscalculation. For example, consider the first scene of the movie, in which the narrator states that at one point, Watanabe was someone who had dreams and ambitions; but now, the purpose of life for Watanabe was merely to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect his own spot\xe2\x80\x9d. Though it is true that the bureaucratic culture encourages Watanabe's behavior, he is presented with opportunities at every minute of his life to create something meaningful; however, he is making a decision to pass up these opportunities and simply \xe2\x80\x9cpass the time\xe2\x80\x9d. One such opportunity, of course, is when he hears about the contaminated pond. \n\tFurthermore, consider the scene when Watanabe is discussing his life with Odagiri (the young woman who becomes his friend). He expresses annoyance at Mitsuo, saying that he has been working for years to provide for him, but that Mitsuo doesn't seem to care. Odagiri responds by telling him that his outlook is flawed. She argues that Mitsuo never asked Kanji to do the work, and therefore that"
